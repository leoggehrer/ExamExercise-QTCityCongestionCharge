### Test Cases for Fee Calculation
**Example 1:** Driving to Linz for work
A passenger car running on fossile fuels enters Linz on a Tuesday at 8:30am and leaves Linz on the same day at 4:15pm.

1 EUR for 8am-9am
1 EUR for 9am-10am
1 EUR for 10am-11am
1 EUR for 11am-12am
1 EUR for 12am-1pm
1 EUR for 1pm-2pm
1 EUR for 2pm-3pm
1 EUR for 3pm-4pm
1 EUR for 4pm-5pm
3 EUR for driving during rush hour
3 EUR for driving during rush hour

Total fee is 9 * 1 EUR + 3 EUR + 3 EUR = 15 EUR
The same trip done with a lorry would cost 15 EUR + 50% = 22,5 EUR. The same trip done with a motorcycle would cost 15 EUR - 50% = 7,5 EUR.

**Example 2:** Staying in Linz for vacation
A passenger car running on fossile fuels enters Linz on a Monday at 3:45pm and leaves Linz on the following Friday at 2:15pm. It was detected driving on streets inside Linz on Wednesday at 9:15am, on Thursday at 4:45pm, and on Friday at 8:45am.

Monday: 9 EUR + 3 EUR = 12 EUR
Tuesday: 20 EUR (because of max. payment per day)
Wednesday: 20 EUR (because of max. payment per day)
Thursday: 20 EUR (because of max. payment per day)
Friday: 15 EUR + 3 EUR = 18 EUR
Total fee is 90 EUR

**Example 3:** Driving to Linz for party
A passenger car running on fossile fuels enters Linz on a Saturday at 5:00pm and leaves Linz on the following calendar day at 1:30am (night).

Saturday: 7 * 1 EUR = 7 EUR
Sunday: 2 * 1 EUR = 2 EUR
No Congestion Charge because of weekend

**Example 4:** Driving in Linz with EV
An EV enters Linz on a Tuesday at 8:30am and leaves Linz on the same day at 4:15pm.

Fee to pay is 3 EUR (CC). The same trip done with a lorry would cost 3 EUR + 50% = 4.5 EUR. The same trip done with a motorcycle would cost 3 EUR - 50% = 1.5 EUR.

**Example 5:** Staying in Linz for vacation with EV
An electric passenger car enters Linz on a Monday at 12:30pm and leaves Linz on the following Friday at 2:15pm. The car was parked during the entire vacation because travelers took public transport in Linz.

On all days between Monday and Friday there is no fee to pay.

**Example 6:** Work and shopping trip on one day
A passenger car running on fossile fuels enters Linz on a Monday at 8:45am and leaves Linz at 3:15pm. The car enters Linz on the same Monday at 5:10pm and leaves again at 6:30pm.

1 EUR for 8am-9am
1 EUR for 9am-10am
1 EUR for 10am-11am
1 EUR for 11am-12am
1 EUR for 12am-1pm
1 EUR for 1pm-2pm
1 EUR for 2pm-3pm
1 EUR for 3pm-4pm
1 EUR for 5pm-6pm
1 EUR for 6pm-7pm
3 EUR for driving during rush hour
Total fee is 10 * 1 EUR + 3 EUR = 13 EUR
The same trip done with a lorry would cost 13 EUR + 50% = 19.5 EUR. The same trip done with a motorcycle would cost 13 EUR - 50% = 6.5 EUR.

**Example 7:** Still in Linz
A passenger car running on fossile fuels entered Linz two days ago at 1:10pm. The car has not left Linz yet.

Fee for the day the car entered: 11 * 1 EUR = 11 EUR
Fee for yesterday: 20 EUR
Fee for today cannot be calculated yet because car might still leave the city.

**Example 8:** Short visit
A passenger car running on fossile fuels entered Linz on a Monday at 1:10pm and left half an hour later at 1:40pm.

Fee to pay is 1 EUR. The same trip done with a lorry would cost 1 EUR + 50% = 1.5 EUR. The same trip done with a motorcycle would cost 1 EUR - 50% = 0.5 EUR.

**Example 9:** Edge case
A passenger car running on fossile fuels entered Linz on a Monday at 1:10pm and left the same day at 2:00pm.

Fee to pay is 2 EUR because 2:00pm counts as a new, started wall-clock-hour.
